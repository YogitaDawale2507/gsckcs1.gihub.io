<p><B>
	The Department of computer science is striving hard towards 
the goal of providing innovative and quality education with high 
standard to achieve academic excellence and provides platform for 
the students to achieve their career goals. With Tamso Maa Jyotirgamaya 
as its guiding principle,  the  Vidarbha Shikshan Prasarak Mandal, Khamgaon
 founded the Govindram Seksariya Science College in 1947 with donation given
 by Late Seth Govindram Seksaria of Indore in order to cultivate the values of 
 modesty, brotherhood, devotion, courage, patriotism, discipline, sacrifice, patience and 
 determination in the youth of the post-independence era.  The late Advocate 
 Raobahadur Anant Sakharam Athalye of Akola was the first president of the VSP Mandal
 while there were some prominent citizens of Khamgaon among the founder members. The
 VSP Mandal is registered under B.P.T. Act, 1950 with registration number F-1 Buldana. 
 In 1954, Khamgaon evolved into G. S. Science, Arts and Commerce College, Khamgaon.

<p>We have started Computer Science in 1987, with two graduate courses BSc Computer 
Science and Computer Application Vocational. Also in 2007 we have started offering
 the graduate courses in BCA. As well as started offering post graduate course MSc
